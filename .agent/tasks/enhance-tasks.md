# Task: Refactor Tasks Page to Industrial Data-Tech

Refactor the `TasksPage.tsx` to align with the new project aesthetic: high-tech, premium, financial-industrial, and sharp geometry.

## 🎨 Design Principles
- **Aesthetic**: Industrial Sharp / Data-Tech.
- **Geometry**: Sharp edges (`rounded-none` or `rounded-[2px]`).
- **Typography**: `font-mono` for dates, counters, and technical status.
- **Color Palette**: Slate 950, Emerald 500, Amber 500, Rose 500 (High contrast).
- **Navigation**: Structured tactical list view.

## 🛠️ Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Foundation & Header
- [ ] Replace standard header with Technical Industrial Header.
- [ ] Implement technical stats bar with sharp borders and mono fonts.
- [ ] Update background to `bg-slate-950` with subtle grain/grid.

### Phase 2: Tactical Task List
- [ ] Refactor task items to use sharp geometry.
- [ ] Implement "Machine State" status indicators (Technical checkboxes).
- [ ] Add hover effects with technical glows and scale-X/Y shifts.
- [ ] Improve priority tags to look like industrial labels.

### Phase 3: Command Controls (Filters & Search)
- [ ] Refactor filter bar to a more technical, segmented control.
- [ ] Sharp search input with technical icons.

### Phase 4: UI/UX & Micro-interactions
- [ ] Staggered reveal animations for task items.
- [ ] Sound/Tactile visual feedback on task completion.
- [ ] Update Modals to the Industrial Form style (sharp, high contrast).

## ✅ Verification Criteria
- [ ] No `rounded-xl` or `rounded-2xl` remaining.
- [ ] Page feels like a "Command Center" for operations.
- [ ] Mobile responsiveness maintained with tactical layout.
- [ ] Lint and Type checks pass.
