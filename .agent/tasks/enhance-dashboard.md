# Task: Enhance Dashboard - Premium High-Tech Financial Core

## Objective
Refactor the Dashboard to be a clean, high-impact "Command Center" where financial data is the dominant heart, maintaining a pure high-tech aesthetic.

## 🎨 DESIGN COMMITMENT (High-Tech / Minimalist)
- **Topological Choice:** Massive Hero Financial Header. Instead of a small card, the "Net Balance" will be a full-width or dominant 70% header with massive typography.
- **Geometry:** Technical Sharpness. Switching from `rounded-lg` to `rounded-[2px]` for a more professional, "instrument-panel" look.
- **Palette:** **Cyber Teal & Signal Orange**. Neutral dark backgrounds (#0f172a) with high-contrast text and specific accent pops. (Strictly no purple).
- **Cleanliness:** Reduced list density. Only showing top-tier KPIs.
- **Motion:** Staggered SVG line drawings and number counters for the balance.

## 📋 Phases

### Phase 1: Preparation
- [ ] Research `SimpleBarChart` and `Card` components to ensure support for sharp geometry.
- [ ] Create number counter hook/component for the financial balance.

### Phase 2: Implementation (DashboardPage.tsx)
- [ ] **Redesign Header:** Create a "Financial Command Header" that takes primary visual weight.
- [ ] **Refactor Secondary KPI Cards:** Shrink stock and suppliers into a more compact, side-by-side technical row.
- [ ] **Task Section:** Simplify to a "Status Bar" style rather than a large card.
- [ ] **Aesthetic Polish:** Add subtle scanning lines or grid textures to the background of the main card.

### Phase 3: Verification
- [ ] Visual audit for "Safe Harbor" clichés.
- [ ] Performance check for animations.
- [ ] Responsive check (Mobile layout).

## 🚀 Success Criteria
- [ ] Financial balance is the first thing and most prominent thing a user sees.
- [ ] The layout feels "Tech/Premium" and not "Generic SaaS".
- [ ] Dashboard remains "Clean" (not overcrowded).
